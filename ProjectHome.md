This project is a PHP function that generates a report. provided an HTML template with variables (supporting one-time use variables as well as multiple instance lists) and a dataset contained with an array.

This was originally built as an internal one-time use function, but it can be expanded upon in several ways.  One example is as follows:

- The input dataset can be expanded to create multiple instances of the report, such as providing a single template, by generating N copies of the report based on the number of entries in the supplied dataset.

I'm open to suggestions.
